These are the official game boards for Hextraction, the hackable, 3D-printable board game. I've created two versions - the Basic model uses minimal filament and prints fast. The "Fancy" Gutter version has many useful features, like ball-catching gutters and detachable feet, but consumes considerably more filament and time.

I've designed this to be as modular as possible, so you can create boards of any shape and size. If you're sizing a leg for a given slot, you want it to be 25mm taller for every additional slot between it and the end zone.

Hextraction is a 3D-printable, modder-friendly board game designed by me, Zack Freedman of Voidstar Lab. In addition to tiles, you'll also need 10mm steel balls or 3/8" slingshot ammo and a game board. To learn the rules and how to get started, watch the Hextraction video!

Hextraction is absolutely free - it's free of charge - all of my models are here on Thangs, commercial use allowed. It's free-form - you can play with any number of opponents, even zero. It's free to modify - you can create your own tiles and configure your own board.
