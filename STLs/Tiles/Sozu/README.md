Flip your game on its head with this wild mechanical tile for Hextraction, the hackable, 3D printable board game.

Like the traditional Japanese water feature, the Sozu Tile has a unique threshold mechanic - the first ball to enter gets trapped, and the second throws the flipper off balance, dumping both balls out of the bottom. The Sozu then resets itself to catch and release again.

It's a tricky cross between the Flipper, Clone, and Trap Tiles, that can block your opponents while accelerating your plays. It's extremely powerful in duels and solitaire, but in multiplayer, it creates more chaos than cleverness.

Print one set of corresponding Tile and Flipper - make sure to select the Flipper that corresponds to your ball diameter! A brim is recommended for the Flipper. Note that the left and right versions are mirror images - their bases and flippers are not interchangeable.

Snap a ball into the flipper. Use an M3x8 screw to mount a 3x7x3mm ball bearing to the base, and GENTLY press the flipper down. Don't press too hard, it'll jam! The flipper should flip freely and snap back up when pressed down. It might need a little grease to run smoothly. I strongly recommend using PETG or nylon to reduce friction!
