Any fan of pro cycling or late-30's European history will tell you: Two balls are better than one. Double your fun with this special tile for Hextraction, the hackable, 3D printable board game.

When a ball passes through the jagged trigger area, roll another ball down the ramp. It's simple but surprisingly powerful, and part of my recommended "starter kit."

Print one or more tiles and snap off the built-in supports, and don't forget to print the rules card!
