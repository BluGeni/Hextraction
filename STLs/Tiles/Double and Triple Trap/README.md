Craft sneaky strategies with these tricky tiles! They trap the first ball to enter each path, allowing you to outmaneuver foes in Hextraction, the hackable, 3D-printable board game.

The Triple Trap Tile can trap up to two balls, one each in different directions. Be careful entering too fast... it can be a bit touchy.

The Double Trap Tile only captures a single ball, but can be installed in four different orientations. It will occasionally trap too many balls, which are easy to knock loose!
