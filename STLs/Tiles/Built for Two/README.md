Stretch your turn to the limit with this eye-popping mechanical tile that unfolds to hustle your ball to the end zone. Make foes flip their lids with this wacky tile for Hextraction, the hackable, 3D-printable board game.

The Tile Built for Two is probably the wildest tile I've ever made - it unfolds like a locket to occupy two slots. Or not - the tile still works when it's folded, so you can drop the whole shebang if you're not interested in living large.

Just remember the rules; you have to play the tile and THEN unfold it, so if the adjacent spot is occupied, you can't whip it out. You can only manipulate mechanisms as you play the tile, and immediately afterward, so if that slot opens up, you're stuck. Still, if you have a way to return this to your hand, maybe you can do some surprise plays?

To keep the profile slim, this tile has lower walls than average. Be careful entering at an angle - you might go right over the top.

Print one top, one bottom, and two links. Use M2x8 screws to connect it up. It'll be a very loose fit - this is important to make it fit all kinds of boards. I recommend gluing a few 6x2mm magnets in the holes to hold it shut.
