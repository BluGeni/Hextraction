Shroud your plays in mystery with these befuddlingly stealthy tiles for Hextraction, the hackable, 3D-printable board game.

With the lids off, these tiles look and act similarly to Basic and Flipper Tiles. But with the lids on, the inner workings are totally concealed, giving you a temporary informational edge while your opponents scratch their heads. Remember to pop the top off before you play it, to see what you've got!

These actually behave a bit differently than the standard versions; to make them totally identical, I put notches in all six positions. This means you can make "illegal" paths that connect top edge to top edge, and bottom to bottom. Balls need a significant amount of momentum to pass through these, so use with caution, and if balls get stuck, you'll have to mentally track when you can remove the tile.

The Secret Flipper is also unique in that it has entrances on all six sides. The upper-left and upper-right entrances are actually always usable, always lead to the corresponding bottom edge, and always tip the flipper in that direction, so the sneaky sidegrade enables more advanced plays. The Secret Flipper uses the same flipper as the regular version, and installs the same way, so visit that page to download the missing piece and get assembly instructions.

The lids should fit the tiles snugly; loose enough to pry off, but tight enough to stay put during a shuffle. You may need to adjust your slicer's hole/circle settings, or slightly scale the Lid up. If you have a multi-material printer, drag the Lid and the Inlay into the slicer together, so the Inlay is aligned with the slot and question mark. Otherwise, print them separately, no supports, and glue the Overlay in place.
