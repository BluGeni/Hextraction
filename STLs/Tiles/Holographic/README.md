Overload the game board in record time with the Holographic Tileframe, a crazy-looking effect tile for Hextraction, the hackable, 3D-printable board game!

It looks like a wireframe, but acts like a time machine - after your ball passes through its skeletonized body, you can play another tile where the path cuts out. Not only does it turbocharge the race to the bottom, it lets you waste opponents' turns by redirecting them off the edge, while giving you twice as many new tiles to throw at them! Don't play this tile recklessly - unless you have a clever trick to jam up your opponent, you might help them more than yourself!

Print the Holo Bottom, the Holo Card, and two each Left Top and Right Top. Glue one set of Tops to the tile, and the other to the rules card.

The crazy aesthetics come at a cost - the Tileframe is the lightest and most fragile tile. Use a tough filament like ABS, and look out for Launchers and straightaways; a high-speed ball can blow it right off the board!
