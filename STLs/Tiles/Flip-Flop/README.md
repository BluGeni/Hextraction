This simple mechanism alternates between sending balls left and right. It's one of the most important tiles in Hextraction, the hackable, 3D-printable board game.

Print one Tile and one Flipper, ideally in PETG or nylon. Insert an M3x8 or M3x10 screw in the flipper, drop an M3 washer onto the tile, align the peg on the flipper with the slot on the tile, and screw it down. Make sure the flipper spins loosely and freely - it might need a touch of grease.

I also snuck in an Advanced version with more entrances. It's more versatile, but also more complex. I recommend printing the basic version first, then upgrading to the Advanced version later.
