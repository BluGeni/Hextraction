These tiles might be nothing but tracks, but they're the bread and butter of the entire game. Along with the board, these are the foundation of Hextraction, the hackable, 3D-printable board game.

These basic tiles are the core of the game - they build more momentum than fancy mechanisms, and they make the game move faster than complex effects. I recommend putting at least one basic tile into the pool per non-basic tile.

The tiles are named for the tracks' appearance - they're not abbreviations, so don't read too far into them!

I also included a blank tile - PLEASE don't print this! It's a base for your own designs, if you'd prefer not to start in Fusion 360.

The S and Z tiles were a late addition, so they have a separate source file: https://a360.co/3VYpz6d
