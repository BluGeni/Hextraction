When nothing remains, everything is equally possible. Dump your hand with this simple utility tile for Hextraction, the hackable, 3D printable board game.

I developed this as an example of a self-explaining tile - you don't need a rules card if the rule is on the tile itself! Discarding your hand is a big deal in Magic, but in Hextraction, it just means you get to cycle in a new one at the end of your turn. The tile's bare-bones path means you'll always have a place to play it. Between us nerds, this one also lets you set up some "illegal" plays that connect the top edge to a top-side edge. Make sure the ball has some momentum!
