IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE?! Hell yeah, brother. Spin up the perfect tile with nothing but this bad boy and one steel ball. Did anyone else actually read Steel Ball Run? I don't think so. This tile was probably a mistake. A mistake for Hextraction, the hackable, 3D-printable board game.

This is an insane-looking tile with a simple triggered effect - sink a ball in there to blow it up, trash a tile from your hand, and search the pool for anything your little heart desires. I wish people knew about Steel Ball Run, it's not a bad series and I got the flavor for this tile JUST RIGHT. Yare yare.

I've actually included two versions - the One Piece version is a solid chunk of plastic, for pirates who are short on time. The Multi version is for cool people with more than one color filament. Print them one by one and glue together, or drag all three into the slicer if you've got an AMS or Toolchanger.

Just remember to print the rules card. Even if you don't want the tile. Trust me.
