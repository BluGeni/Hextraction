Beam your balls with this gravity-defying combo tile for Hextraction, the hackable, 3D-printable board game.

This wombo combo lets a ball leap around the board, opening intricate new routes to victory. I consider it one of the most important tiles in the game - just throwing a few into the pool makes every slot on the board into relevant territory. It has the most rules of any tile in my "core set," but the payoff is worth it.

This tile is also a great introduction to effects - it's got a Limit, a Trigger, and an On Play effect in the form of the combo.

The Teleport Tile is a combo - print both tiles and both cards. The two sub-tile pieces should nest smoothly and remain tightly clasped. For authenticity, print the In parts in light blue, and the Out parts in bright orange.

Remember to sign both halves, so you can reassemble your combos after the game!
