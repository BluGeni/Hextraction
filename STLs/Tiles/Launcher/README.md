Make a strategy that defies gravity with this kinetic tile for Hextraction, the hackable, 3D-printable board game. Warning: It'll put your eye out.

When a ball enters the Launcher Tile, its effect activates - pull back the spring-loaded pusher and release it to fire the ball into the upper-left or upper-right edge. Positioning is important - since almost every tile is designed for balls to enter the TOP edges, very few will work if you start at the wrong end of the ice-cream cone. Prepare by stocking the pool with extra Asterisks, Pachinkos, Gears, "illegal" basics, and other compatible tiles. The Flipper Tile actually DOES work with the Launcher, provided the flipper is pointing in the other direction.

For the strongest launch, brace the tile against the board with one hand, while using the other to launch. The snappier the release, the stronger the launch. PLEASE don't let kids play with this tile - while it shouldn't be powerful enough to injure anyone, accidents do happen. You also don't want your vile offspring firing pencils out of this thing.

The Launcher Tile has a print-in-place mechanism - simply print the tile with supports enabled on the build plate only. Don't use PLA or composites - you need the lowest friction possible. After printing and cleaning up, use a Q-tip or toothpick to apply a plastic-safe grease to the slider track, and use tweezers to install a McMaster 9044K11 extension spring on the pegs below. Depending on your printer's support interface settings, you may need to thin the pegs down with a craft knife to fit the spring.

Also, don't forget to print the rules card - this uses a triggered effect to fire the ball!
