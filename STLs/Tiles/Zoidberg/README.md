You want a tile? Why not Zoidberg? Confound your opponents til they whoop whoop whoop with this crustacean companion for Hextraction, the hackable, 3D printable board game.

The Zoidberg tile might not have any effects, mechanisms, or a real MD, but it does have tons of nooks, crannies, and divots to gobble up multiple balls. It's like a Trap Tile on DMT - maybe it'll jam up the entire table, maybe it'll backfire immediately. It's ambiguous AND amphibious!

Also, you can glue 10mm magnets onto the goofy eyes... or better, glue on some GOOGLY eyes. Y'know, in case it isn't chaotic enough as-is.
