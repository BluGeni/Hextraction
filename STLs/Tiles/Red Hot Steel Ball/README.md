The Red Hot Steel Ball Tile superheats your ball to 5,000 imaginary degrees Centigrade, burning through gimmicks, blockades, and anything else between you and the end zone. Melt a path to victory with this fancy effect tile for Hextraction, the hackable, 3D-printable board game.

The RHSBT is an effect tile with the same paths as the basic Peace Tile, but with a powerful effect - if the ball stops on a tile, you can destroy it right away, as if two other balls were also blocked. By shredding anything that blocks the ball, the RHSBT turbocharges the game and neutralizes any plan involving Trap Tiles and similar trickery. Just remember, if the outlet is blocked, the RHSBT can incinerate itself!

Since this is an Effect Tile, remember to print the rules card! You can also glue bits of filament in the little holes to craft the cosmetic "heating coil."
