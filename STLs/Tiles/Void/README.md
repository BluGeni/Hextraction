Sow chaos and destruction with this high-variance tile for Hextraction, the hackable, 3D printable board game. It redirects balls, it ramps balls into the air, it eats a ball and it ceases to exist. The singularity is now!

The Void Tile is a volatile alternative to the Asterisk Tile that works in any orientation. It actually has two rules - a Trigger that makes it act like the edge of the board, and a Limit that forces you to experience the chaos before your opponents. Remember that rules card!

Just don't come in too hot - at high speed, balls can hit the lip so hard they're sent flying! Maybe you'll be lucky enough to cheese out a sleazy victory from afar?
