Make your foes' heads spin with this revolutionary tile for Hextraction, the hackable, 3D-printable board game.

The Gear Tile's triggered effect lets you lift up an adjacent tile and turn it one notch in either direction. Remember, a notch isn't 60 degrees, it's as far as necessary to make it sit flat. Just be careful if it's got balls on it; if they fall off the tile, you're the one who rolled them! Pull off ten-dimensional gigabrain plays like toggling paths, reversing mechanisms, resetting Trap Tiles, flipping Launchers, and more.

The tile itself can also create some neat strategies - that big peg in the middle can make it behave like a Pachinko, Peace, or DIC Tile.

Don't forget to print that rules card... and some on-theme steampunk copper filament.
