Turn your opponents' plans into a smoldering crater with this bulbous banger. It might be the most excessive explosive in Hextraction, the hackable, 3D-printable board game.

The Enormous Cartoon Bomb is pretty much what it says on the tin - it's a big, fat cannonball bomb ripped straight out of Looney Tunes and plopped right onto your game board. The effect triggers when the three-ball rule destroys the tile, causing it to take all of its neighbors down with it. For best results, line up a few copies in a combustible conga line to set up a devastating chain reaction.

This tile isn't just silly - it's genuinely useful in multiplayer games, where conflicting plays constantly clog up the board. It'll create just enough breathing room to get a new tile in play, while significantly delaying the Overdrive endgame. Don't forget that rules card!
