Sorry, oops, coming through, don't mind me... nothing's more annoying than an overly polite tile shouldering in on your turf. Shove your way to victory - gently - with this tactically awkward utility tile for Hextraction, the hackable, 3D printable board game.

As a rare self-explaining tile, this one has the rule printed right in - when you play it, swap it with an adjacent tile. It also tells you to apologize, though Rule 0 keeps this from affecting the gameplay. Do it if you want, or don't... you jerk.

Not only does it have nothing but a single teeny-tiny turn, it can be placed in "illegal" ball-trapping positions. Y'know, in case shoving your opponents' plans aside isn't obnoxious enough already.

Also, you can technically use this to move a ball up the board if you play it next to some kind of King Tile variant that lets you wait a turn? I don't know, this tile's a jerk.
