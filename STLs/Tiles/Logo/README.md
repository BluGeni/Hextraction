I designed these tiles for the release video of Hextraction, the hackable, 3D-printable board game. They're meant to be decorative, but if you're adventurous, you could play them! My goal was a cool-looking title card shot and thumbnail, not fun gameplay, so they have downright bizarre track arrangements that don't work in many orientations. If you're an experienced player, these could spice up your pool without bogging you down with rules and mechanisms. If you're new, I recommend printing another tile instead.

Print the A parts face-down on the plate, and the B parts face-up. Enable ironing on all top surfaces. Print the Overlays in a contrasting color. Glue each tile's A and B parts together, then glue the Overlay on top.

While these have notches in all six positions, they were intended to be installed with the text pointing towards the bottom-right. Other orientations will make many of the paths unusable. Also, be gentle - these tiles weren't intended to be shuffled, so they're particularly fragile.

If you'd like to improve these, I recommend closing some of the notches to restrict the orientations, and maybe rearranging some of the tracks. I was also thinking of adding a rule: "The 'TRAC' tile overwrites the 'HEX' tile's neighbors, and the 'TION' tile overwrites the 'TRAC' tile's neighbors." Or maybe "When a roll ends, if the 'HEX,' 'TRAC,' and 'TION' tiles were touched exactly once, in that order, rearrange any number of tiles and roll again."
