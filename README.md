I found it hard to navigate and collect all the tiles on Thangs and wanted to make it easier to see all the tiles and download them at once.

All tiles to print are in the STL folder with READMEs and links to the original are in the named folder.

Mods included:

- a full size board
- coming soon.. 1 piece legs


Please open a pull request or send me any files or changes you want included.
